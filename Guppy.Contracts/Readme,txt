Contracts Readme
------------------------------------------------------

The design goals of the contracts project are as 
1)	Allow projects to define WHAT they do for consumers 
2)	Allow projects to hide HOW they do what they do for consumers 

------------------------------------------------------

This provides a central location where interfaces can be defined, allowing projects to share functionality without sharing the means by which this is achieved.

Both IDal<T> and IService<T> may need further extension. These cases are covered in greater details in the projects themselves, however when extending these interfaces please consider.

1)	It is likely that existing work already uses the un-extended version (IDal<T> or IService<T>) so consider making a new interface that extends the existing ones.
2)	Expected behaviour is that methods called the same , act in the same way. E.G IService<Widget>.Get(32) would return the equivalent  of IWidgetService.Get(32)
